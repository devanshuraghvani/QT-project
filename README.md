How to run the code?

#Qt Files

1. Open the project file: 3.pro in the QT Software.
2. Click the run button to build the project.
3. Write some text in the text editor window.
4. Select the text and then click the editor option on the top left corner.
5. Select the options Bold/ / Superscript/ Subscript as required. 

# What has been done?
First of all, Bold / Supersscript/ Subscript options were added in the mainwindow.ui Then the code for these were written in the mainwindow.cpp

#Issue Faced
1. Issue was found in in-built code. I was not able to run the code so i am not getting output of bold, superscript and subscript.
